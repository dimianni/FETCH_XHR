# Retrieving data from a server with old XMLHttpRequest and modern Fetch API
I am using two REST API's - [Rick and Morty's](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#rest) and [JSON Placeholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).

## To clone the repo, run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dimianni/FETCH_XHR.git
```

## Details

There are two files linked to index.html: 

- xhr.js 
- fetch.js 

Feel free to link/unlink the files, and uncomment peices of code.
